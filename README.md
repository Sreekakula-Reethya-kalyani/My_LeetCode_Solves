# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are organized by problem categories such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, etc. Each solution is written in Java, and includes an implementation for solving the problem as efficiently as possible.

## Problem Solving Approach

I strive to implement optimal algorithms for each problem, focusing on:
- Time complexity
- Space efficiency
- Code readability and simplicity

## Languages Used

- **Java** (Primary language)
- Solutions are written with best practices in mind and aim to be as efficient as possible.

## Repository Structure

- **`Arrays/`**: Contains solutions related to array manipulation problems.
- **`Strings/`**: Includes string manipulation and pattern matching problems.
- **`DynamicProgramming/`**: For dynamic programming-related problems.
- **`Others/`**: Miscellaneous solutions that don't fit into the above categories.
